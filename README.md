Project Idea: Analyzing news data from Kaggle to determine which news is reliable or unreliable.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data

Machine Learning: We want to develop a model that will classify which articles are fake or not. Need to determine which algorithm will provide us with the highest accuracy percentage.
